Scenario 1: Car Class
Objective: Learn to uncomment code to create a class and an object.

Instructions:

Uncomment the code to define a class Car and create an object.
The Car class should have fields model (String) and year (int).
The class should have a method displayInfo that prints the car's model and year.
In the main method, create an object of the Car class, set its fields, and call the displayInfo method.

Note: The creation of objects using the main method is just for your understanding. It will not be evaluated. Only the classes will be evaluated.
